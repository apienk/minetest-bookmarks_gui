**Warning:** This fork has been modified to work with the EDUtest/MinetestEDU project. If you wish to use it on a normal server change the privilege name in _init.lua_ back to `server` or use the original mod from https://github.com/cornernote/minetest-bookmarks_gui.

## Features

## About (from the original mod, please respect)

This module is open source, so it's distributed freely. If you find it useful then I ask not for your wealth, but simply to spare your time to consider the world we share by watching [Earthlings](http://earthlings.com/), a multi-award winning film available to watch online for free. A must-see for anyone who wishes to make the world a better place.
